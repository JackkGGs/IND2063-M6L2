Hello there. This is a simple code example from me and my groupmates. The code only utilizes very little resources, and it's made to be customizable.

It uses the Discord API and custom logic. It doesn't use JSON so it won't need to sync with the network to receive data

Thanks for reading! Please don't hesitate to change this code to your needs.
